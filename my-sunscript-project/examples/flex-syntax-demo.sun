I want to create a simple calculator app that can do basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
It should have a nice user interface with buttons for numbers 0-9 and the operation buttons.
When the user clicks the buttons, it should show the current calculation on a display.
There should also be a clear button to reset everything and an equals button to show the result.
Make sure to handle division by zero errors gracefully.
